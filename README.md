[FlowChat](https://flowchat.tk) is an open-source, self-hostable, live-updating discussion platform, like a chatroom, but with threaded conversations, and voting. 

Flowchat tries to solve the problem of having a live group discussion, while being able to have threaded, side conversations, so every comment doesn't have to interrupt the flow. 

It features:
- A complete chat application live updating, and threaded discussion.
- Private or public discussions
- Customizable discussion and comment sorting by recentness, and popularity.
- Discussion hashtags
- Discussion creators can block users, or delete comments
- [Range voting](http://rangevoting.org/UniqBest.html), not simple thumbs up or thumbs down, for mass expressiveness, for both comments and discussions.
