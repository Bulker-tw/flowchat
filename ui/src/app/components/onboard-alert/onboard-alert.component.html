  <h3>Welcome to FlowChat!</h3>
  <p><a [routerLink]="['/']">FlowChat</a> is an open-source,
    self-hostable, <strong>live-updating</strong> discussion
    platform, featuring communities, discussions with
    threaded conversations, and voting.
  </p>
  <p>It can act as an alternative to forums, as a private
    team communication platform(like slack), a content
    creation platform(like reddit), or a voting/polling
    platform like
    <a href="https://referendum.ml" target="blank_">referendum</a>.</p>
  <p>Flowchat tries to solve the problem of having a fluid,
    free-feeling group chat, while allowing for side
    conversations so that every comment isnâ€™t at the
    top level. Multiple conversations can take place
    <strong>at once</strong>, without interrupting
    the flow of the chatroom.</p>
  <p>It uses <a href="http://rangevoting.org/UniqBest.html"
      target="blank_">range voting</a>(also known as
    olympic score voting) for sorting comments, discussions,
    and communities. Range voting is <em>more expressive</em>    than simple thumbs up or thumbs down votes.</p>
  <p>Check out the default community, <a [routerLink]="['/community',1]">vanilla</a>,
    or create your own. Check out a sample discussion
