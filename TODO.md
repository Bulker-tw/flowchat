  - Possibly tunable for each thread creator?
  - comment and discussion ranking based on: 
    - recentness
    - # of votes
    - avg_score 
    - and weighting factors for all three
  - Have these be set up by the discussion mods?

- Add ability to remove your own comment, without actually deleting the comment and its subtree
- Toastr / whatever messages for errors, message notifications
- Able to delete your own discussions
- Favorite/'watched discussions', anything you comment in is automatically added to favorites/saved.
- Serving multiple discussions
  - All discussions have a single moderator, whoever created the channel.
    - For private, any emails that aren't in the system should get emailed a link to the discussion.
  - Tags/Hashtags(with smart linking)(maximum of 3 - 5)
  - Discussions on left [1](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/examples/dashboard/)
  - Set up like Stash, [nodebb](https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB), reddit
  - Left bar will be all your discussions that aren't archived(x'd out)
  - When you comment in a discussion, it gets added to your left bar.
  - Don't want mods to be able to squat on tag names, want community moderation.

- Add discussion editing for owners
- Create discussion page

- Fix login system, automatically set cookies, temp button for clear cookies, if auth is undefined, then don't show the top right user button.
- Links, or left bar with discussions? Are you making a reddit alternative, or a slack alternative? Team-based discussions, or thread based?
- Comment sort broadcasting for peoples votes? Seems excessive, but could be very useful for sorting. 
  - This is done, except for the resorting on the front end based on avgRank. 
  - Also avoids having to reload the page.
  - Would require resorting(and repulling) all the parents of that comment, just like editing.
  - Top level ones would require a full resort... seems excessive.
- Voting on discussions
- Add schema for discussion title, discussion link, discussion tags
- Fixed userbar on the right, that looks pretty

- Automatic setting of cookies for anonymous users
- Refresh only specific changed content
  - For now, use newCommentId.
  - Automatically Scroll to new comment - location.href = "#myDiv";
  - Change them to a new highlighted color, then remove that.
  - Should you scroll when you are currently replying, or wait till after, or not at all?
  - Recursion: [1](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2549333/1655478) [2](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16228467/how-do-i-break-out-of-loops-in-recursive-functions) [3](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34522306/angular-2-focus-on-newly-added-input-element)

- Comment subset loading
  - What happens when you get too many comments?
